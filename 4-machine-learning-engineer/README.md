# Machine Learning Engineer
This job is to build smart products that automate tasks and deploy them. To do this, they care more about prediction accuracy than traditional statistics. They are more computer scientist than statistician. They train/teach machines to independently perform various useful tasks that are typically low impact but high quantity.
