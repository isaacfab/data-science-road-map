# Data Science Skills Road Map

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-green) ![]((https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-MIT-green))

### A prioritized list of **core skills**, **personal portfolio projects**, **reading material**, and **practice assignments** every new data scientist should have.

This repo is a companion site for the course [CORE: Data Science and Machine Learning](). 

![image to enroll with a discount for 10 dollars]()

The goal here is very ambitious; to be the only site you need on your learning journey as a data scientist. Getting started in **data science** is hard. There is an overwhelming number of resources and suggestions. The goal of this road map is to get you started (or re-directed) on your journey the right way. Everything from original content to linked resources has been vetted through experience and practice. Start with foundations:

## [Foundations](1-foundations)

Data jobs come in three general flavors (but are often called different things in practice); Data Analyst, General Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Engineer. The skills, course, and resources are divided into these categories for ease of reference.

## [Data Analyst](2-data-analyst)

## [General Data Scientist](3-general-data-scientist)

## [Machine Learning Engineer](4-machine-learning-engineer)

## Combined Core Skills List
This table is the set of skills that should be common to every data scientist. There are many things excluded that become important as individuals specialize. This list represents the absolute foundation.
