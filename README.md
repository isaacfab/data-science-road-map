### A prioritized list of **core skills**, **reading material**, **personal portfolio projects** and **practice assignments** every new data scientist should have.

This repo is a companion site for the course [CORE: Data Science and Machine Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/4287096/?referralCode=ADF695AD40B8F269D6BF).

The goal here is very ambitious; to be the only reference site you need on your initial learning journey as a data scientist. Getting started in **data science** is hard. There is an overwhelming number of resources and suggestions. Many people give up!

The goal of this road map is to get you started (or re-directed) on your journey the right way with NO knowledge gaps. Everything from original content to linked resources has been vetted through experience and practice. 

Data jobs come in three general flavors (but are often called different things in practice); Data Analyst, General Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Engineer. The skills, course, and resources are divided into these categories for ease of reference. Pay close attention to recommended books to add to your library, several are **must reads.**

## [Certification Checklist](#certification-checklist)
Certifications are a tricky thing. They don't really demonstrate mastery but can make the difference on getting an interview. Here are our minimum recommended certifications. However, if you cannot afford to complete these certifications don't worry! Use the Kaggle courses and LinkedIn Assessments instead and let your project portfolio show your competence!

## [Portfolio Project Checklist](#portfolio-project-checklist)
We recommend you use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) to host your protfolio as [shown in the course](https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/4287096/?referralCode=ADF695AD40B8F269D6BF). Recommended minimal list of hosted pojects:

1. 2x MS Excel dashboards - hosted as webpages
2. 1x Tableau Public dashboard
3. 1x Tableau Public story
4. 2x EDA of a dataset using RMarkdown - published on Kaggle as well
5. 2x EDA of a dataset and ML modeel development using Python - published on Kaggle as well
6. 1x deploy an ML model to the clouding using AWS (or similar) EC2 and a docker container

[The course walks you through](https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/4287096/?referralCode=ADF695AD40B8F269D6BF) or gives resources needed to complete each of these. Make sure you use novel datasets in your portfolio! If you only use the data from the course it will be very similar to everyone else... 

## [Next Steps](#next-steps)
If you have completed the certification checklist, built a resume and hosted project protfolio you are ready to start work! The next step in your learning journy should be to decide which of the job types you want to dive deeper into. Here are the recommended next learning resources for each:

1. [Data Analyst - Work to become one of the Tableau Visionaries](https://www.tableau.com/community/community-leaders/visionaries)
2. [General Data Scientist - Create and publish an R Package to CRAN](https://r-pkgs.org/)
3. [Machine Learning Engineer - Complete the fast.ai course 'Deep learning for coders'](https://www.fast.ai/)
4. [Everyone - compete in a competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
